Instructions
------------

1. Install mtuq within a conda virtual environment following these instructions

    https://uafgeotools.github.io/mtuq/install/index.html


2  Within the same virtual environment install mtbench

   >> cd mtbench
   >> pip install -e .


3. Download waveform data

  >> bash WAVEFORMS/download.bash


4. Run scripts

  >> cd scripts/
  >> python run_Silwal2016_syngine
  >> python run_Alvizuri2018_syngine


5. Optionally, compare your results with the expected output

  >> bash FIGURES/download.bash



Notes
-----

 - AxiSEM and FK scripts closely reproduce published figures, but require local Green's function databases (avilable at University of Alaska Fairbanks)

 - syngine scripts do NOT closely reproduce published figures since AK135F is used in place of regional velocity models

- syngine scripts download Green's functions from a remote server, which take a long time. After the initial downloads, Green's function are locally cached, so any subsequent runs will be much faster.
